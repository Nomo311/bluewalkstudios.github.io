          I created a story-focused video essay for the indie game, Salt and
          Sanctuary, titled “Journey in a Bottle”. This project consisted of
          recording a considerably sizeable amount of footage before syphoning
          through 200 GBs worth of recordings and then organizing it in a
          cohesive and coherent end-product. The video essay was made by using
          OBS Studios for the recording aspect and Vegas Pro 18 for the editing.
          While Journey in a Bottle was a personal project, it had proved my
          practical skills of being able to thoroughly comprehend the entirety
          of a game’s world and narrative, and then be able to express said
          world and narrative toward a large group of people. This is a
          particularly useful skill as a designer who focuses on game mechanics
          and narrative through game mechanics, as well as an aspiring project
          lead who needs to convey the tone and story of a project to their
          team.
