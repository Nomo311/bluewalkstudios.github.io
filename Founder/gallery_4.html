          I developed the framework for my senior capstone “The Magic City
          Beats,” a game concept heavily inspired by the Castlevania series, but
          with a stronger focus on platforming, tight controls, and minimalist
          yet stylish combat mechanics. My intention for this project was to not
          just create a game that players could only wish was fully complete,
          but to also be the best project presented at my senior capstone, and
          undisputably so. This project was created using Game Maker Studio 2
          alongside Microsoft Paint for the development and the sprite work
          respectively. And this demo version of my capstone acts as the
          progenitor, benchmark, and guideline for the rest of development
          moving forward. Ultimately, Magic City Beats will display all of what
          I’ve learned throughout my academic career; game design, storytelling,
          art, and music, while also doubling as a love letter to my hometown,
          Gary, IN. In short, I expect it to be my magnum opus.
