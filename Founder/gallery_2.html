          I co-developed an on-rails shooter by the name of “Supermoon 64,”
          which took the player through a world of over-the-top concepts and
          nonsensical humor as a way to both have a laugh at, and have a laugh
          with, the tropes this project pays homage to. Such tropes involve
          concepts popularized in Japanese media as well as the American
          appropriation of said tropes via ‘Mary Sues.’ I was responsible for
          the user interface of this project, as well as the sound design,
          player models, and game-narrative. The project was created in Unity,
          but the 3D models were made in Blender and the majority of the UI and
          heads up display, or HUD, was made in Microsoft Paint. This project
          was my first introduction to the practical reality of game development
          within a group and sharing responsibilities for the overall quality of
          a project. And ultimately, this project expresses my skills to
          thoroughly have enjoyment in building around such a concept as ‘joy’
          and ‘passion’ are what retains a game’s integrity throughout its
          development.
